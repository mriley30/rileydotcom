            I'm an engineer, a builder of keyboards, a reader of sci-fi and fantasy, a hopeless addict (not really) to World of Warcraft, a meathead, and a sports lover. 
            Below you'll find a glimpse into my interests along with some cards about my technical expertise. I am a backend expert and I have begun venturing into frontend. I've done work for all sorts of clients,
            from local clients to government contractors.

                My whole life, for better or worse, I have been attached to the hip of video games. It started 
                when my dad got Unreal Tournament (1999) for the PC (don't ask). At the time, I was 5 years old, so luckily
                swearing and foul language was turned off!
              </p>
              <p>
                Still, that started my love of computers and technology. I went from a PC, to a PS2, to an Xbox 360, then back to a PC.
                Over-saturating my life with computers, games, sci-fi, and fantasy, I was sure I wanted to be a game developer. But, 
                I didn't know for sure until I took my first programming class as a Senior in High School. But, at the same time, despite the 
                preivous mentions of all things tech, I was a bit of a meathead. I love sports, and I'll always say that if technology somehow evaporated,
                I would have been a sports performance trainer or football coach. 
              </p>
              <p>
                I wanted to play football in college. However, since I am only 5'11" and not 6'4", I opted away from Notre Dame and enrolled 
                at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, where I earned my Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering with a minor in Mathematics, while becoming an 
                All-American defensive lineman. I loved my time at Rose and met so many awesome people through football and my fraternity.

                It's also where I met my now fianc√©, who has been my rock and support since 2019.  
              </p>
              <p>
                So, I continue to be a nerd and meathead. I work as a software engineer by day, and do mythic raiding in World of Warcraft by night, while finding a way to
                get to the gym 4 times a week.
