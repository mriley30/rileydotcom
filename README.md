## About

This is a repository for my personal website, where I put the contents of my resume out with style. It's a pet project where I can learn to master some frontend skills.

## Running the site locally

You'll need to have npm installed. Once that is achieved, clone the respository and run this in the terminal:
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`
